# Reimagining Code Explainer: Evaluation-First Code RAG

Vision: A research-grade, production-friendly framework to develop, evaluate, and explain code with rigorous, open, and trustworthy evaluation.

Guiding principles
- Evaluation-first: every feature ships with evals, metrics, and ablations.
- Transparency: provenance, citations, and datasets with lineage.
- Reliability: judge calibration, error bars, and sensitivity analyses.
- Practicality: fast smoke suites, nightly subsets, weekly full runs.

User journeys
- Researcher: plug in a new strategy/model and get eval cards + plots.
- Practitioner: run “zero-to-results in 15 minutes” with small datasets.
- Reviewer: verify results and reproduce reports locally.

North-star artifacts
- Eval Cards, Dataset Intake & Lineage, Provenance Cards, Leaderboard-lite.
