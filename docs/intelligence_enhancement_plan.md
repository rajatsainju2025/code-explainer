# Intelligence Enhancement Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Capabilities
1. **Multi-Strategy Support**: vanilla, ast_augmented, retrieval_augmented, execution_trace, enhanced_rag
2. **Multi-Language Detection**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++ (basic)
3. **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Structural, Semantic, Context, Performance, Security, Verification agents
4. **Cross-Language Analysis**: Basic cross-language pattern detection
5. **Type-Safe Wrappers**: Modern interfaces with validation

### Current Limitations
1. **Language Support**: Limited to basic detection patterns, no proper parsers for non-Python languages
2. **Context Understanding**: Shallow AST analysis, no semantic understanding of design patterns
3. **Explanation Quality**: Template-based prompts, no adaptive explanation styles
4. **Learning**: No feedback mechanism or explanation improvement over time
5. **Domain Knowledge**: Limited to basic stdlib documentation, no specialized domain support

## Proposed Intelligence Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Language Support
- **Tree-sitter Integration**: Use Tree-sitter for robust parsing of multiple languages
- **Language-Specific Analysis**: Implement language-specific idiom and pattern detection
- **Polyglot Code Support**: Handle mixed-language files and cross-language calls
- **Framework Detection**: Recognize popular frameworks (React, Django, Spring, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Context Understanding
- **Design Pattern Recognition**: Identify and explain common design patterns
- **Code Smell Detection**: Recognize anti-patterns and suggest improvements
- **Dependency Analysis**: Understand import relationships and external dependencies
- **Business Logic Extraction**: Identify business rules vs. technical implementation

### 3. Adaptive Explanation Generation
- **Audience-Aware Explanations**: Adjust complexity based on target audience (beginner/expert)
- **Interactive Explanations**: Support follow-up questions and clarifications
- **Visual Explanations**: Generate diagrams and flowcharts for complex logic
- **Example Generation**: Create relevant examples and test cases

### 4. Domain Intelligence
- **Algorithm Recognition**: Identify specific algorithms and data structures
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze time/space complexity and bottlenecks
- **Security Analysis**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities
- **Best Practices**: Suggest language/framework-specific best practices

### 5. Learning and Feedback
- **Quality Scoring**: Evaluate explanation quality using metrics
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learn from user ratings and corrections
- **Explanation Caching**: Cache and reuse high-quality explanations
- **Continuous Learning**: Update knowledge base with new patterns and practices
